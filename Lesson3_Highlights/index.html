            <p class="lead">In the simplest possible form, version control is a method of organization. It allows for revision without disorganization. Version control is useful for groups and  individuals alike. When an individual is constantly making and editing documents, programs, websites, etc. it is important to not get files mixed up and  keep them in order. Version control allows people to do this with ease. It also allows you to retrieve previous or original versions of all your files. Version control is helpful in group situations because it is very easy for different members of a group to confuse the names of the files which may lead to a larger problem down the road.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to include JavaScript when creating an HTML document. You can either create an external file for the JavaScript or embed it directly into the HTML document. If you are creating an external file, you need to include directions in the HTML document. To do this you create a script element in the head of the HTML document with a src attribute that refers to the external file containing the JavaScript by name. The external file is typically saved in the HTML file. It is beneficial to use an external file for JavaScript because it separates it from the HTML document and facilitates the programmer when they want to re-use it for another page or application.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Although creating an external file for the JavaScript of an HTML document can be very beneficial, some programmers like to embed the JavaScript directly into the HTML document. In order to do this you have to code the JavaScript directly into the script element of the head section of the HTML document. Although embedding the JavaScript isn’t as beneficial in the long run, some users prefer this method because it allows for faster programming. By using this method the programmer does not have to switch back and forth between the HTML document and the external files for the JavaScript code.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order for your web browser to be able to understand your JavaScript code, a select number of rules have to be followed when coding which are called syntax. The first rule of syntax is to be very careful with lowercase and uppercase letters because JavaScript understands the same letter in lowercase and uppercase to be two completely different letters. The second rule is to end all statements with a semicolon which lets JavaScript know when one statement ends and another begins. The third rule is to be careful with whitespace. For the most part JavaScript ignores whitespace but if lines aren’t split in good spots JavaScript will try to assist the process and add a semicolon for you when you don’t want it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When creating the JavaScript code for an HTML document a programmer has to differentiate between different objects, functions, etc. This is done so by the use of identifiers. Identifiers have a set of rules that need to be followed as well. In addition to the rules it is helpful to give identifiers significant names. It is not smart to abbreviate the names of identifiers because it is very easy to forget the exact abbreviation you used and misspell it. When using two words for identifiers it makes it easier to follow either the camel casing method or underscore method. When using underscore method the words are separated by an underscore. When using camel casing method all words in the identifier have their first letter capitalized minus the first word.</p>
